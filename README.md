# Frontend Take-Home Exercise at Fetch Rewards

### Your task is to build a webpage with a user creation form. The form should take the following required inputs:

Full Name
Email
Password
Occupation
State
Occupation and State should allow users to select from options returned by an endpoint. Users should only be able to select one occupation and one state. [A GET request](https://frontend-take-home.fetchrewards.com/form) will return a JSON body with the following format:

```
{
    "occupations": [
        "occupation1",
        "occupation2",
        ...
    ],
    "states": [
        {
            "name": "Alabama",
            "abbreviation": "AL"
        },
        ...
    ]
}
```

You should submit the results of the form to the same [endpoint](https://frontend-take-home.fetchrewards.com/form) via a POST request with a JSON body of the following format:

```
{
    "name": "???",
    "email": "???",
    "password": "???",
    "occupation": "???",
    "state": "???"
}
``` 

The POST endpoint will return a 201 status code if all fields are provided. The response body will be the created user object. It does not perform any validation beyond this.

Minimum Requirements
Your site must:

Display a form with inputs for each field outlined above
Allow a user to complete and submit the form
Do not allow form submission without completing the entire form
Provide feedback upon successful form submission

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
